Coursera-ML
===========

## Synopsis

Assignments submitted as a part of ML course on Coursera July 2014. 

Majority of code is written in Octave 3.8.2 and some in 3.8.1.

This page documents the assignments that I did as part of the [Coursera machine learning course](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture). Following are the topics covered-

Linear Regression with and without regularization
Logistic Regression with and without regularization
SVM
Neural Networks
Principal Component Analysis

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
